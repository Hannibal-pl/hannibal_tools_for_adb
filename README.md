Attempt to create schematics/boadrview ? form CAD data for Plexus P/20
computer presented at Adrian's Digital Basement Youtube channel.

I've abandoned it, since electronics componet position data seems to
place it in ridiculous places. Example output svg file is also added
to the repository.

I share this code, because parser code can be usefull to someone.

Originaly, I've planned to draw all pins on each element and made it
clickable. Clicking on pin were supposed to light up all other connected
pins along with its numer and node description. If this functionality
will be useful to you, let me know. I consider to finish this project.
