Attempt to create schematics/boadrview ? form CAD data for Plexus P/20
computer presented at Adrian's Digital Basement Youtube channel.

I've abandoned it, since electronics componet position data seems to
place it in ridiculous places. Example output svg file is also added
to the repository.

I share this code, because parser code can be usefull to someone.
